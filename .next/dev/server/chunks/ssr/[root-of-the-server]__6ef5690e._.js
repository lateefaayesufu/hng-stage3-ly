/**
 * The functions provided by this module are used to communicate certain properties
 * about the currently running code so that Next.js can make decisions on how to handle
 * the current execution in different rendering modes such as pre-rendering, resuming, and SSR.
 *
 * Today Next.js treats all code as potentially static. Certain APIs may only make sense when dynamically rendering.
 * Traditionally this meant deopting the entire render to dynamic however with PPR we can now deopt parts
 * of a React tree as dynamic while still keeping other parts static. There are really two different kinds of
 * Dynamic indications.
 *
 * The first is simply an intention to be dynamic. unstable_noStore is an example of this where
 * the currently executing code simply declares that the current scope is dynamic but if you use it
 * inside unstable_cache it can still be cached. This type of indication can be removed if we ever
 * make the default dynamic to begin with because the only way you would ever be static is inside
 * a cache scope which this indication does not affect.
 *
 * The second is an indication that a dynamic data source was read. This is a stronger form of dynamic
 * because it means that it is inappropriate to cache this at all. using a dynamic data source inside
 * unstable_cache should error. If you want to use some dynamic data inside unstable_cache you should
 * read that data outside the cache and pass it in as an argument to the cached function.
